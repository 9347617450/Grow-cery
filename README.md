INDUSTRY NAME : Lifestyle

Project Title : Grow-cery

Problem Statement / opportunity :  people are very afraid to come out to shops or markets to buy vegetables or daily needs. This becomes a big problem for them who are staying in cities because cities are mostly affected by corona due to the more number of gatherings in public places and due to high population. This becomes a big task to put on thier lives to death.

Problem Description : The solution to the problem is done by using microsoft azure. I got opportunity to work on microsoft azure sevices by hosting my app in static web app services. Microsoft providing many services. This helps my project to upload to google and make people use it by browsing. The core idea of  my project is to help the people in this pandemic by delivering the essential needs through website. These days many companies are delivering only goods and other items. Only the less number of companies delivering essential daily goods. The main solution of the problem is by delivering the daily organic vegetables and other essential needs within the couple of hours after ordering through website. SO people can receive orders to doorsteps without going out. This helps them stay home and stay safe.
